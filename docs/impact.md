# Impact

## Problem addressed

Manual position sizing is error-prone during fast market conditions and often leads to inconsistent risk discipline.

## Outcome

RIZZK provides a repeatable, math-first workflow that reduces manual calculation mistakes and supports disciplined trade execution.

## Practical value

- Converts account/risk inputs into consistent execution targets.
- Gives traders a clearer pre-trade checklist before placing orders.
- Supports journaling with explicit risk/reward framing.

## Employer signal

This project demonstrates ability to ship practical user-facing tools with clean core logic, testing, and deploy-ready documentation.

## Next roadmap

- Add scenario presets for common trade setups.
- Add richer history analytics and export options.
- Add deployment health checks for public app availability.
